    "Provide three output formats via --output json|yaml|plain: JSON is the canonical lossless format, YAML preserves structure with quoted strings and --- separators, plain applies suffix-driven human formatting (epoch_ms \u2192 RFC 3339, _bytes \u2192 human-readable, _secret \u2192 ***, _ms \u2265 1000 \u2192 seconds)"
