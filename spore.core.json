  "synopsis": "The field name is the schema \u2014 agents read latency_ms and know milliseconds, api_key_secret and know to redact, no external schema needed",
  "intent": [
    "Encode all semantic information in the field name itself so agents parse structured data without external schemas, documentation, or type systems \u2014 _ms/_s/_epoch_ms for time, _msats/_sats/_usd_cents for currency, _bytes for size, _secret for auto-redaction",
    "Define a JSONL output protocol where every line carries a code field (startup for config state, tool-defined for status/progress, ok/error for results) plus a trace object for execution context (duration, token counts, cost, data source) \u2014 same structure whether the transport is CLI stdout, REST API response, MCP tool result, or SSE stream",
    "Provide three output formats via --output json|yaml|plain: JSON is the canonical lossless format, YAML preserves structure with quoted strings and --- separators, plain applies suffix-driven human formatting (epoch_ms \u2192 RFC 3339, _bytes \u2192 human-readable, _secret \u2192 ***, _ms \u2265 1000 \u2192 seconds)"

  "changes": [
    "Rename internal module abbreviation from AFD to AFDATA across all four language implementations (Rust, Go, Python, TypeScript), updating module names, file names, package declarations, and inline documentation to use the full AFDATA identifier for consistency with the library name",
    "Replace the startup reserved protocol code with a generalized log code carrying an event field, so startup state is now emitted as {\"code\": \"log\", \"event\": \"startup\", ...} \u2014 enabling the log code to carry any diagnostic event type (startup, request, progress, retry, redirect) rather than requiring a dedicated reserved code per event",
    "Remove build_json_startup() from the public API across all implementations now that startup is a log event \u2014 callers build startup lines using the standard log helpers with event: startup, reducing API surface and aligning implementation with the unified log protocol"
